# Capacity_Calculation-pipeline
This repository provides code to calculate building volumes for the Braunschweig Großraum region and enrich building footprints with semantic information. It integrates ALKIS building and land-use data with OpenStreetMap buildings, POIs, land-use, and building-use attributes to create an enriched building level dataset.
